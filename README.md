## General info
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data theyâ€™ve been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to.
This project performs the extraction and transformation of data coming from user logs and music plays from sparkify's music streaming app. In addition, we carry out the modeling of a dimensional database using star schema modeling. Finally, the project loads the transformed data in this database for further analysis of this information. The image below shows the data model.
